          Our Story
        </p>
        <p>
          TripAdLowCost began in 2018 as a project by founders Nathan Bessa, Esteban Boucher and TÃº Cao. Their consultants gave birth to the idea that people anywhere would want to share their experiences with strangers (or, as we like to call them, friends you haven't met yet).
